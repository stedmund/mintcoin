Abstract  & Introduction

The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best 
shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one
ends, and where the other begins?

Edgar Allen Poe, The Premature Burial (1850)



We propose that survival is the underlying shared objective of our human condition. Furthermore we propose that liberty is the primary metaphysical manifestation of that of objective.  

Before we go further, it is essential to separate the term liberty from freedom. Both terms are abstract notions that exist on a spectrum we can not negotiate and therefore will always struggle to define.

Purportedly, both suggest a lack of restraint and an ability to chose. However, where freedom knows no bounds, liberty must carry the burden of responsibility wherever it goes. Liberty is grounded, freedom is intangible. 

Ergo, the logical consequence of responisibility associated with liberation is the pursuit of security.
